# typing-Speed-test-using-Tkinter-python-GUI-project
Python program using Tkinter as a GUI for desktop application that tests your typing speed.

# How it works 
The sentences list has been defined in an `Array` or `List` of whish your words needs to match with one of the sentences randomly to get the program tested. It then  `start_test` method displays a sentence and starts a timer. The elapsed time and words per minute (WPM) calculates and `check_result` when "Enter" button is pressed on keyboard. However, the word per minute (WPM) is calculated by dividing the word count by the elapsed time (in minutes) and the application checks for the equivalent sentence and give a response if the target sentence matches or negative result if else.
